    <!-- There are 2 types of units:

    inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
    pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
    points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
    picas (1pc = 12 pt) -->

    <div style="font-size: 1px;">

    </div>

    <!-- 2.Relative units: Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

    Relative units consists of 
    em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
    ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
    ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
    rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
    vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
    vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
    vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
    vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
    %	Relative to the parent element -->
